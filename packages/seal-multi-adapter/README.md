<h1 align="center">SEAL <br /> Multi Adapter</h1>

<br />
<br />

The `MultiAdapter` allows to write into multiple adapters.

> **Note**:
> This project is heavily under development and any feedback is greatly appreciated.

## Usage

It is mostly used in combination with the `ReadWriteAdapter` to still write into both indexes.

The following code shows how to create an Engine using this Adapter:

```php
<?php

use CmsIg\Seal\Adapter\Elasticsearch\ElasticsearchAdapter;
use CmsIg\Seal\Adapter\Multi\MultiAdapter;
use CmsIg\Seal\Adapter\ReadWrite\ReadWriteAdapter;
use CmsIg\Seal\Engine;

$readAdapter = new ElasticsearchAdapter(/* .. */); // can be any adapter
$writeAdapter = new ElasticsearchAdapter(/* .. */); // can be any adapter

$engine = new Engine(
    new ReadWriteAdapter(
        $readAdapter,
        new MultiAdapter(
            $readAdapter,
            $writeAdapter,
        ),
    ),
    $schema,
);
```

Via DSN for your favorite framework:

```env
multi://readAdapter?adapters[]=writeAdapter
read-write://readAdapter?write=multiAdapter
```

> **Note**
> The `MultiAdapter` does not support the `search` method and so the `ReadWriteAdapter` is required.
